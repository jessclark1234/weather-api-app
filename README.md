This project was to show my knowledge on how to parse through information provided by OpenWeather API and any other API. My task was to build a 5 Day Weather Report for any city in the world. Simply type in a city name and you will be able to view the weather for the current day and 4 days after that. 


## Installation

There is no installation needed in order to use this application.

## Usage

This applcation can be used to look up a 5 day weather forecast for anywhere in the world. Simply type the name of the city you wish to see the weather of or click one of the major city buttons for easy access.

## Testing

Testing consisted of figuring out CSS layout and parsing through the data provided by the OpenWeather API to see what I needed to put on the page.

## Credits

A special thank you to my tutor, Andrew Hardemon, for helping me parse through the data provided by the API and figure out how to fix my CSS issues.
